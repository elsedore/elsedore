👋 Hi, I’m Elsa Doré.

💼 I'm a Data Analytics Consultant based in Paris, currently working in the automotive tech industry.

👀 I’m interested in analysis and prediction related to product analytics, healthcare, and user experiences. My work typically focuses on predictive analytics, reporting & insights, and defining new metrics. The tools I primarily use are Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and GCP.
🫢 Fun-fact, I also have a software development background [here my formal github space](https://github.com/sheismeld).

🌱 I recently worked on articles personnal recommandation systems based on user preferences for an online wearing shop. I'm currently learning more data scientist stuffs.

💞️ I enjoy building communities in analytics & tech. I'm a member of Data For Good, helped on participating in Climate and Biodiversity projects, and you can usually find me in one of their Slack communities.
